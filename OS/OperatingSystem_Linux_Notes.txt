Same with Windows notes but on Linux
File listing: ls/ 
to know more about flags use: ls --help
Lookup files: man ls
for more info about files: ls -l /
All option: ls -la / = ls -l -a
also use pwd, cd and so 
create files: mkdir my_cool_folder or mkdir my\ cool\ folder or mkdir 'my cool folder'
Verify: ls 
Exact for coping 
Removing is just like windows: rm name 
rm -r name (Recurse)
